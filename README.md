# 2022 WEB Program

This year (2022), I decided to lead the way for current and future developers. This won't be just through my articles but also personal coaching.

## Reasons to become a developer?
- No one is born as a developer. If you want, you can be one!
- You don't need a CS degree to be a developer, trust me!
- The current market needs developers! So if you learn web, you'll definitely find a job and why not your dream job!
- Didn‚Äôt find a job in your field? Convert to a web developer and with a few years of experience, you'll be negotiating and picking the job you want!
- You can be well paid in this field.
- You won't be alone. I'll be your personal coach, and I'll do my best to share my knowledge and assist you in growing.
- It's never late!

## The game's rules:
- Be a [follower](https://famzil.medium.com) and [subscriber](https://famzil.medium.com/subscribe) to the newsletter to receive the roadmap articles. The rhythm won't be intense (only 2 to 3 articles per week). This will give you the time to read the article, learn from it, and ask all your questions.

- Questions process:
    - ‚úãFor a general question that doesn't need personal coaching or support. You are invited to ask them in the comment section of the article.
    - ‚úãFor more technical needs or issues in your code (because there will be a lot of code in our journey), I invite you to DM me on my LinkedIn account. I check it every day.

Note: üó£Ô∏è By the way, I speak English, French, and Arabic. So feel free to ask me in any of those languages if you prefer)
